# Node Chat app

A realtime chat app that lets users join rooms with the ability to send their location. Uses socket.io, node/express and mustache. This is a code along from [Complete Node Develop course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/)

## Enhancements
My own additions to the project

* Join page shows a list of active rooms in a dropdown
* Prevent clients joining a room with the same user name
* Clients can leave room
* Room names are case-insensitive
* Trim spaces from room names and user names
